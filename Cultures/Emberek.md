# Emberek
The Emberek are a hardy culture of humans who live on Boone and deal with spooky shit constantly.

 - Singular: Embyen
 - Location: Boone
 - Size: 1 to 2 moderately large cities, many dispersed townships
 - Climate: Cold, arboreal weather. Most townships are in a vast swamp that freezes during the winter. Flooding is extremely common in those regions. Most trees are of the cold weather variety.

## Cultural Disposition

-   The Emberek are a hardy people, but welcoming of outsiders. A lone traveler is usually able to count on the hospitality of them to find a warm bed and meal during the winters provided they do not outstay their welcome. Most Emberek live on farms, and usually those farms are the same ones their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents lived on as well. The growing season is short, so it's mostly subsistence farming supplemented with hunting.

## Politics

-   While there is a more unified government for Boone, most Emberek are content to ignore it, and just want to be left alone to tend to their crops and crafts.

## Religion

-   Emberek religion is based around cycles of reincarnation. It’s believed that there are a set number of souls available for every creature. When a creature is born, a soul is taken from the Pool or Medence. When a creature dies, its soul is sent to a different pool - The Inbetween or Koezte. The number of creatures being born is constantly accelerating, eventually the Medence empties and no new creatures are born. When that happens all who are still alive are privy to the remaking of the universe. Those who survive that become the first generation of the new universe and are tasked with teaching the ways to the next. However, souls that are trapped in soul gems are destroyed when the universe is remade. Because of this most Emberek find soul gems distasteful at best, and outright blasphemous at worst. There is a moral element to the religion, the shittier you are in life, the shittier your time in the Koetze will be. Particularly terrible people will be born with disabilities in the next Cycle

## Architecture

 -  As the region is apt to flooding, most buildings are on stilts, with elevated walkways between them. The stilts themselves are usually made of stone. The buildings themselves often have a stone first story, and every story above that is plaster and timber frame. Most buildings are two stories tall, but can be up to 6 stories in important location.

## Names

 - People names follow two schema: the first is their last name is a descriptor of them(Erik [the] Red, for someone with red hair), the second is an action they did(Leo (who) shot). The names are then translated into Czech so Erik Cervene and Leo Vystrel. First names are more generic and are similar to German names. You won’t get any bobs or franks however. 
 - Place names are just a descriptor of the location translated to Hungarian, for example, a town with a river going through it would be River(town) so the town would be called Folyo.


## Appearance


-   The Emberek usually have blond hair and brown eyes, and it is fashionable to have bushy and well groomed mustaches or goatees. They are shorter than average, and the average woman is taller than the average man. 

## Spooky Shit

 - The Fog - during spring, a thick white fog blankets the region. Otherworldly sounds can be heard from it. It’s advised to walk outside in groups of 3 or more else you may vanish. Local traditions say it’s caused by the echos of destroyed souls from the last cycle.
 - Will-o-wisps - strange lights that draw travelers deep into the swap at night during the summer. Caused by a crocodile like creature.
 - The Bazaci(singular bazant) or Swampmen - 50 to 100 years ago there was a war between the Emberek and migrants from Bahuaro. The Emberek used hit and fade tactics to deadly effect against the migrants, and would frequently force columns of the migrants into the swamp, drowning them. They arrived in summer and were hurting bad when spring rolled around. With the spring came the Fog, and the Emberek renewed their offensive with great zeal. 1/2 the migrants that spring were killed by the Emberek, 1/4 by the Fog and the remainder fled. Fast forward to modern day, and some Emberek like to scavenge the old battlegrounds for materials. Those who do tell stories of the Bazaci, the bloated, black corpses of the migrants who were taken by the swamp or the Fog. Usually, attacks by Bazaci are isolated incidents. But one night 57 years after the war, around 300 Bazaci swarmed over the town of Csatater killing most.
