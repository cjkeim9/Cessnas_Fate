# Tsellminsk/Porcelain Gnomes
Th Tsellminsk are a tribalistic culture of gnomes living on Alterra.

 - Singular: Tsellmin
 - Location: Alterra(Called Tsellanlân by the gnomes)
 - Size: 3/8ths the population of Alterra

## Cultural Disposition

-   Tsellminsk are extremely tribalistic, and most cities are composed of a single clan, though exceptions can be found on the continent where population density is at its highest. They do not trust those from outside their clan, especially“standard” gnomes. Every porcelain gnome in a clan has the same “last” or public name. Alongside this, the gnomes are loathe to share their “first” or personal name to outsiders, leaving many poor travelers confused as to which gnome they were speaking to. This combined with a low diversity in appearance has caused several conspiracy theories as to their origin, for example they’re all escaped clones or that they’re eusocial creatures not unlike ants.

## Politics

-   Alterra is presumably a republic, but Gnomish politics often resembles that of a feudal society, where arranged marriages for political gain are common and a given clan usually holds the same political office. Towns operate as direct democracy.

## Religion

-   Tsellminsk follow the commandments of the Trijegoaden(Treej-goad-an), a council of three gods. The first is the Soldaat(Soldier) who’s domains are obviously war, but also agriculture. The second is the Dichter(Poet) who’s domains are all things art, nature, diplomacy. The third is the Kening(King) who controls the natural elements and physics. Tsellminsk burial customs are quite a bit different than other cultures, after a gnome dies, they are ceremoniously stripped of flesh and the bones are encased in porcelain. The bones are then distributed to the gnome’s descendants(the eldest son gets the skull) who are then expected to incorporate the bones into their house in some manner. Ancient houses have entire rooms made from the bones.

## Architecture

 - Most Tsellminsk living in medium to large towns arranged in concentric circles. In the center of the circle is a massive circular hydroponics tower. The size of the tower is a source of pride or shame for all the gnomes living in that town. Tsellminsk architecture makes heavy use of a pure white, glassy material made from sand dredged from the deeps for housing. Almost every building is heavily decorated with a combination of blue filigree(usually in the shape of vines or flowers) and carvings of the clan emblem(usually a bird, but fish are not unheard of, especially among the floating cities). Their houses are usually 1 story affairs, with a circular living/dining room in the center

## Names

 - Tsellminsk names are in the form clan-name personal-name. When an outsider asks for a name, most of the time they will respond with their clan name. Clan names are usually a generic bird or fish translated into Frisian. Personal names are an adjective usually ascribed to the bird/fish translated to Frisian. For example Earn Grut(Eagle Great) and his clan mate Earn Gau. From the neighboring clan you could have Forel Slank(Trout Slim).


## Appearance


-   Porcelain gnomes look unusually similar to the next, and non-gnomes often struggle to tell two apart. They universally have black hair, white/gold eyes, and white skin. They are usually clean shaven.

## Miscellaneous

 - In the capital, the two largest clans have banded together to create a space elevator. The Porcelain Spire, as it is called, is approximately halfway to completion. Stylistically, it's a graceful, flowing structure made of the same porcelain-like material the rest of their buildings are made of.
 - The ocean remains relatively unexplored, and several species of mega-fauna have been discovered. Most prominently, a parrot beaked shark the size of a blue whale called a Pappegeei.
