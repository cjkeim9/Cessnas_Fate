## HISTORY
General History of Bahuaro and Space Travel

Several millenia before the modern day, the world was in turmoil. The nations of Bahuaro were at an uneasy truce in a decades long war, with tensions flaring on both sides.
Though the names of the nations involved have been forgotten, the eventual result was clear: the war would begin again, and with the weapons that had been developed during
the short lived peace, the world would end. On each side, a small voice in the shouting, were the astronomers: something was coming. A large object had been sighted on a 
direct course for the twin planets, potentially on a scale that could end all life. As the object was nearing Bahuaro, it shifted course, apparently crashing onto Alicante. 
This object was, in fact, a ship; a colony ship for the elves. The elves made their presence known in short order, and expressed their intention to find another race of 
peaceful beings. Desperate to respond to an unexpected first contact in the middle of a war, the leader of one side made a quick decision and greeted the elves as the leader
of Interworld, the unified planet's ruling body. The opposition saw the value in the farce, but resented the side that led it. After several years, and with both sides 
waiting for the new, superior force to act, an armistice was quietly enacted, with the agreement that neither side would choose the head of the new governing body. The decision was
brought before the elves, now established in their own city and sharing their knowledge of science and magic with the world. This tradition has been continued, 
with a secret council deciding who to place before the elves for consideration.

Approximately 1500 years before the present day, observations of the movements of Navis led to the launch of two sattelites, known as Railsat 1 and 2 to the Lagrange points between 
the planets. Held in place by the conflicting gravitational fields, these sattelites acted as stable points to tether and amplify the magic the elves had shared of space flight, enabling 
much faster and less dangerous travel between Bahauro and Alicante. Large scale solar flares around this time also led to the discovery of what is now known as Sunwater, the fuel for
modern space travel. Experiments with this new compound and the mixture of magic and technology led to the creation of megaships, which could travel to other worlds.
These ships were, and still are, incredibly dangerous to operate, with approximately one in three being destroyed by the energy used. Despite continued research and improvements,
the safety of these ships have only marginally been improved, with around one in five being destroyed. After initial surveys of the worlds in the system, megaships were sent to 
first Arcades, then Isken and Alterra. These initial ships carried not only the full required resources and population for colonies, but also prototypical sattelites similar in 
nature to the original Railsats, with much more advanced magical and technological power sources. These sattelites formed the Solar Rail, the basis of safe transportation around the
system. The Solar Rail can be used by ships much smaller than the megaships, as the rail provides most of the safety and navigation to travel between worlds. Ships will tether to the
rail, allowing them to expend their fuel to accelerate without need to steer or decelerate, and the rail provides power for the more mundane systems such as life support. This created a
much greater demand for the fuel, leading to the founding of Sunwater Corp. This corporation owns all territory and property on Isken, and is the only legal source of fuel, both for the
megaships and for smaller ships wanting to travel via the rail.
